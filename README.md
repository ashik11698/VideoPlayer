## How to use
initialize the AVPlayerManager with following parameters
- navigationController: This is optional. If there isn't any navigationController, then pass nil instead of it.
- view: Pass the view(UIView), where the player will be placed. 
- isLiveStream: This is boolean. Pass 'true' if it is a live stream, else pass 'false' if it is pre-recorded video.
- isAutoPlayOn: This is boolean. Pass 'true' to turn on autoPlay and pass 'false' to turn off autoPlay.
- playList: This is a list of urls, which will be played by the player. This is optional. User can send their own playList [URL?]. Avoid this parameter if there is no playList, player will play the default playList in that case. 

```
let avPlayerManager = AVPlayerManager(navigationController: navigationController, view: view, isLiveStream: false, isAutoPlayOn: false)
```

Or,

```
let avPlayerManager = AVPlayerManager(navigationController: nil, view: view, isLiveStream: false, isAutoPlayOn: true)
```

Or,

```
let playList = [Urls.m3u8Video1, Urls.m3u8Video2, Urls.m3u8Video3]

let avPlayerManager = AVPlayerManager(navigationController: navigationController, view: view, isLiveStream: false, isAutoPlayOn: true, playList: playList)
```

Add the initialized constant/variable as a subview of the view the player will be visible.

```
view.addSubview(avPlayerManager)
```

Call the 'setUpPlayer' method/function to configure all the things and play the video. 

```
avPlayerManager.setUpPlayer()
```
